原文地址：[A beginner’s guide to customer journey maps](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/customer-journey-maps/)

When it comes to designing products that are both useful and memorable, there is little else in the design process that’s more important than cultivating a user-centric approach to our work.

> 在设计既有用又令人印象深刻的产品过程中，没有什么比培养【以用户为中心】的工作方法更重要的了。   

We can design and iterate and do design sprints for weeks on end, but the results of our work will be hit-or-miss unless we’ve taken the time to understand the real needs and actual experience of the person we’re all here for: the end user. 

> 我们可以连续几周进行设计、迭代和设计冲刺，除非我们花时间去了解最终用户的真正需求和实际体验，否则我们我们的工作结果将是不可预知的。   

In this guide, we’ll cover the basics of one important tool for developing a stronger focus on our end users: the customer journey map. 
> 在本指南中，我们将介绍一个重要工具的基本知识，这个工具可以帮我们更好的关注目标用户：用户体验地图

### 什么是用户体验地图？
A customer journey map, also known as a user journey map, is a visual representation of the path a user takes from beginning to end in accomplishing a specific goal with your product.   
> 用户体验地图，也称为用户旅程地图，是用户在产品中完成特定目标的路径展示。   

The backbone of a customer journey map (CJM) is a timeline of sorts, following the succession of touchpoints (thinking here of Moments of Truth and micro-moments) that occur between the user and your product or organization. Touchpoints come in different shapes and sizes, including:
> 用户体验地图的主干是一个按照接触点的顺序排列的时间轴，   

- How the user discovers your product in the first place ？ 
- 用户如何发现你的产品？
- Their first experience on your website/app
- 他们在你的网站/应用程序上的第一次体验
- The first bit of navigation they interact with to find what they’re looking for
- 他们通过导航发现目标
- A click on the menu that takes them (or doesn’t) where they want to go
- 通过点击菜单跳转（或不跳转）到目的地
- An order confirmation email
- 订单确认邮件
  
Customer journey maps are a visualization of these touchpoints, along with their context and likely (or evident) outcomes, and often provide context as well—drawing the company’s goals and user’s emotions into the picture. 
> 用户体验地图是这些交互的可视化，以及交互的上下文背景和可能产生的（或已经产生的）结果。在上下文背景中，将公司目标和用户情感体验相结合。   

### 用户体验地图是做什么的？
So why not just have a meeting to present the company’s goals and the ways the product is or is not meeting user needs?
> 那么，为什么不通过召开会议来讨论公司的目标和产品是否符合目标用户的需求呢？   

CJMs are particularly effective in making the user’s actual experience clear to everyone involved in creating the CJM—and to everyone who receives the final deliverable.
> 用户体验地图向参与者以及最终交付者清晰的展示了用户的实际体验。   

They place a real user (or a close approximation, through personas) in front of team members, decision-makers, and key stakeholders. And this generates one key element essential to good UX: empathy.
> 用户体验地图向团队成员、决策者和利益相关者展示了一个真正的用户（或者塑造了近似的用户角色），让人们产生了好的用户体验中的关键因素：同理心。   

Empathy matters in UX design. It keeps the user right where they belong—at the forefront of design decisions. 
> 同理心在用户体验设计中很重要    

### 设计过程中什么时候需要CJM？
Customer journey maps are useful at any point in the design process where there is a high potential for the focus to drift away from the user and their real needs. Let’s look at the five stages of the design process, and where or how a CJM might come in to play. 
> 用户体验地图在设计过程中的任何时候都是有用的。在这个过程中，用户的注意力很大可能会偏离用户的真实需求。让我们来看看设计过程中的五个阶段以及CJM可能在哪里或如何发挥作用。

### 第一阶段和第二阶段：同理心和定义
A CJM is an effective way to transition from the first to the second stage of the design process. In Stage one (Empathize), you’re doing all the user research that gives you the data you need. In Stage 2 (Define), you’re narrowing your focus down to the key problem(s) you need to solve. A CJM is one way to take your data points and the expertise of your team and stakeholders and put it all in one place—with the user as the focal point. The fact that this will be delivered in a visual format helps you to:

> CJM是从设计的第一阶段过渡到第二阶段的有效方式。在第一阶段（同理性），你做了所有的用户访谈（用户调查），得到了你所需要的数据。在第二阶段（定义阶段），你把注意力集中到需要解决的关键问题中，CJM是一种将你获取的数据、你的团队和利益相关者的专业既能集中起来的方法 -- 以用户为中心。事实上，这是一个可视化的表格，帮助您做以下事情：

- Minimize discrepancies between individual conceptions/mental models. By getting thoughts and ideas out in the open and in a visual format, everyone can see what the combined thinking of the group is.
- 尽量减少个别概念/心智模型之间的差异，将思维与想法以可视化的形式表达出来，让团队中的每个人看到团队中的整体思维
- Find common ground. Everyone can feel heard and have a chance to discuss what they see as the key touchpoints, problems, etc. This kind of communication often generates consensus.
- 找到共同点，兼顾每个人的感受，并有机会讨论他们各自认为的关键点和问题，这种沟通帮助我们产生共识
- Establish a shared vision. There’s less room for speculation about user needs when the needs of many users have been combined into what is essentially the journey of one composite user.
- 明确需求的方向，当许多用户的需求被组合成复合用户的体验时，对用户需求的猜测会逐渐减少

### 第三和第四阶段：构思和原型
A CJM gives your team a tangible starting point for the third stage of the design process (Ideate) and a strong foundation for moving into the fourth (Prototype). In stage three, the goal is to generate as many ideas as possible to improve, change, expand, and otherwise iterate on your product. Here, a CJM can help:
> CJM为团队提供了设计过程中第三阶段（Ideate）的切实起点，为进入第四阶段（原型）奠定了坚实基础。在第三阶段，目标是产生尽可能多的想法来改进、优化、扩展或迭代您的产品，这时CJM可以帮助您：   

- Generate new ideas
- 产生新的想法
- Narrow down the existing pool of ideas to the ones that are the most user-centric 
- 将现有的想法以用户为中心进行精简

Regardless of whether you’re planning to generate low-, mid-, or high-fidelity prototypes, going into Stage 4 with a CJM in hand will help ensure that the work remains true to the person we’re all here for—the end user. Print that CJM out, tack it to the wall, and keep your user at the center every step of the way. 
> 无论你是否打算制作低保真、中保真或高保真的原型，CJM在第四阶段将有助于确保产品始终符合最终用户的需求。把CJM打印出来订在墙上，让你的需求始终围绕用户构建。

### 第五阶段：测试
As you conduct the testing required in the fifth stage, keeping your CJM as a reference point can help you see how the new, hopefully improved, journey compares to what it looked like before the work of stages 3 and 4. Here, the CJM can act as a signpost for where you’ve been—highlighting how design decisions have impacted the customer’s journey with your product.    

> 当您进行第五阶段所需的测试时，保留您的CJM作为参考，可以帮助您了解跟第三、第四阶段相比有哪些新的、期望的改进。在这里，CJM可以作为你的路径指标--强调设计决策是如何影响用户体验   

### 用户体验地图剖析
Do an image search for customer journey map and you’ll see a wide variation in the kind of deliverables people come up with. This speaks to how widely useful CJMs are as a tool for understanding the end user and how they will experience your product. They are versatile and adaptable to a wide variety of products, teams, and organizations. But this versatility can also make it difficult to pin down the exact form a CJM “should” take, there are a few key components that are common to most CJMs.    

> 搜索用户体验地图，你会发现人们会得到多种多样的结果。这说明CJM具有非常广泛的用途，作为理解目标用户以及他们如何体验您产品的工具。适用于各种各样的产品、团队和组织。但是这种多样性使得我们很难确定CJM的具体形式，有一些关键组件是大多数CJM所共有的。

Now, enough talk—let’s have a look at an actual customer journey map and deconstruct it. Below, we have a CJM constructed for a hypothetical mobile app designed to help surfers find the safest times and places to go out on the water. 

> 现在，讨论结束了，让我们来看一下实际的用户体验地图并对其进行解析。下面，我们为一个假想的应用程序创建了CJM，这个应用程序旨在帮助冲浪者找到最安全的时间和地点去完成水上冲浪。   

![Sample customer journey map for Vela—a mobile app for surfers (image credit: CareerFoundry)](/images/design/CJM_Alex_whole.png)

In this instance, we’ve created the CJM in the early stages of the design process. At this stage, we don’t have a developed app with the concrete steps that Alex will have to take to “check general conditions,” for example. And we certainly haven’t had the chance (yet) to have any features or development oversights trigger overtly negative emotions in the user’s experience. 

> 在这个实例中，我们在设计过程的早期阶段创建了CJM，在这个阶段，我们没有一个开发的应用程序的具体步骤，Alex将不得不采取“检查一般条件”的方式。例如：我们目前没有机会让产品功能或BUG在用户体验中触发明显的负面情绪   

#### 区域A：用户、场景、目标

![Zone A of the Vela customer journey map—a mobile app for surfers (image credit: CareerFoundry)](/images/design/ZoneA.jpg)

The very top of the CJM gives context. It tells us who our user is and what their motivations and goals are as they interact with our product. Here, we learn some basic information about Alex (age, location, job, relationship status), what is motivating her use of the app in the first place, and what she wants to accomplish with the app. 

Note: CJMs are often based on the experience of a real or composite user. There is some debate about personas versus Jobs-To-Be-Done, but having some research-substantiated representation of the user at the very top of the CJM is the standard and highly effective practice. 

#### 区域B：阶段
![Zone B of the Vela customer journey map—a mobile app for surfers (image credit: CareerFoundry)](/images/design/ZoneB.jpg)

Underneath the user-centric umbrella of Zona A, we have the chronological journey Alex will take through our app. First, she’ll check the general weather conditions, then select a few potential sites, etc. This will end with Alex accomplishing her goal, and heading out to a safe location to catch a wave. Don’t get too hung up the particular labels here. The important thing is to capture the broad steps. 

#### 区域C：任务、思维、情感
![Zone C of the Vela customer journey map—a mobile app for surfers (image credit: CareerFoundry)](/images/design/ZoneC.jpg)

This part of the CJM gets into the details of what the user will do, think, and feel in each phase of the journey. We watch as Alex checks the general surfing conditions; we understand the motivating thought; we know that she feels hopeful that weather conditions will allow her to get out on the water after work. Then we move to the next phase and the tasks and thoughts change as Alex becomes indifferent, and so on. 

Note that there is some variation in what CJMs accomplish in this zone, largely dependent upon what is important for the company as a whole, and for the project in particular, as well as the people involved in it. Remember that your goals in this zone are to 1) understand what’s happening on the user’s side of things that the product team wouldn’t otherwise be privy to, and 2) discover opportunities to eliminate problems and create a fantastic experience for the user. This leads us to Zone D.

#### 区域D：时机
![Zone D of the Vela customer journey map—a mobile app for surfers (image credit: CareerFoundry)](/images/design/ZoneD.jpg)

At the bottom of the CJM, we have the opportunities we’ve discovered—the capabilities, features, and fixes that will optimize Alex’s experience of our app. In the final phase, for example, we know that Alex will want to look at multiple locations and will likely develop some favorites. So why not allow her to save those locations so that she can check them even more easily next time she uses the app? 

Many CJMs also include a focus on internal ownership in this zone. This helps the individuals or teams involved to hone in on the opportunities they will take an active role in developing. 

### 过程概述

But what goes into the creation of a deliverable like the one we’ve just dissected? Here’s your list of essential ingredients (typically introduced in this order): 

- Research. Gather all the data you’ve distilled from user interviews, usability tests, surveys, and any other insights into how people actually engage with your product.
- People. Bring your researchers, developers, designers, content writers, and key stakeholders in and let them contribute to the process. The combined insight of a group this diverse will help ensure that you are getting the full picture of the product and the user’s current experience with it.
- Collaboration—whether in person or remote. Often, this takes the form of an in-person workshop, in which participants share knowledge and observations (usually with Post-it notes aplenty). If a workshop in real-time isn’t feasible for the teams involved, or you want to save on Post-its, there are countless tools available to aid remote collaboration in this process.
- The goal is to gather information and observations from people across every aspect of the product’s development and organize them in a way that allows everyone involved to see the narrative arc of the user’s experience with the product.
- A sketching tool. This is where you get into the piece-by-piece construction work of putting the final map together. While there are plenty of templates out there, few of them are fully customizable to fit your product and your organization. We recommend building your own CJM with a sketching tool like InVision Freehand.
- The result: A nicely organized and polished deliverable for the stakeholderswho weren’t able to participate (and to keep as a reference throughout the design process!). 

### A final word（尾声）

This guide is only an introduction to customer journey maps. There are many ways to approach, adapt, and implement this extremely versatile UX design tool. The way you utilize it will depend largely upon your team, your product, and the particular design challenges you’re taking on.
